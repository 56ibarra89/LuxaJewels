# Project Setup with Create React App and Material UI

This project was initiated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and incorporates Material UI to enhance the user interface with ready-made React components styled according to Material Design principles.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. This will enable you to run the necessary scripts and manage dependencies.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will also install Material UI components along with other project dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command starts the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Executes the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Visit [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode, optimizes the build for best performance, and minifies the build with hashed filenames. The application is now ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there's no going back!**

If you need to customize your build tool and configuration choices, use `eject`. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This allows full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still function, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed.

## Using Material UI

Material UI is used in this project to provide well-designed visual elements. You can import any Material UI component and use it within your React components to maintain a cohesive design language. For example:

```jsx
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

function App() {
  return <Button variant="contained" color="primary">Click Me</Button>;
}
```
